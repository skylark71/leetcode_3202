# Intuition
To solve the problem of finding the longest subsequence such that the sum of any two adjacent elements modulo `k` is constant, we need to keep track of valid subsequences as we iterate through the array.

Initially, we may think of trying all subsequences, but that would be too slow. Instead, we can use dynamic programming to efficiently track the longest valid sequences based on modulo conditions.

# Approach
We use a 1D dynamic programming array `dp` of size `n * k`, where each entry `dp[i * k + mod]` stores the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` with the required modulo value `mod`.

For each pair of indices `(j, i)` where `j < i`, we calculate `(nums[j] + nums[i]) % k`. If `dp[j*k + mod]` already contains a value, we can try extending that subsequence by 1. We then update `dp[i*k + mod]` with the maximum value.

We also keep track of the global maximum length found during the process.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:  
  $$O(n^2)$$  
  We process all pairs `(i, j)` where `j < i`, and for each pair we do constant-time operations.

- Space complexity:  
  $$O(n \cdot k)$$  
  We store a DP table with size proportional to `n * k`.

# Code
```go
func maximumLength(nums []int, k int) int {
	n := len(nums)
	dp := make([]int, n*k)
	maxLen := 1

	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		for j := 0; j < i; j++ {
			mod := (nums[j] + nums[i]) % k
			prev := dp[j*k+mod]
			if prev == 0 {
				prev = 1
			}
			idx := i*k + mod
			if prev+1 > dp[idx] {
				dp[idx] = prev + 1
				if dp[idx] > maxLen {
					maxLen = dp[idx]
				}
			}
		}
	}
	return maxLen
}
